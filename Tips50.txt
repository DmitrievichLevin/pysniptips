$Cap$ This is the first of many Python Tips & Tricks to celebrate the start of a new Front-End Developer position! I've created a Snappify Clone in Python and you can check out the code in a public repo "PySnipTips" @ https://github.com/DmitrievichLevin #100Devs

print("Hello Developers! More exciting things to come!")

'Hello Developers'

***

$Cap$ Creating a sequence of numbers (zero to ten with skips)

range(0,10,2)

#[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

***

$Cap$ Summing a sequence of numbers (calculating the sum of zero to ten with skips)

l = range(0,10,2)

sum(l)

20

***

$Cap$ Checking whether any element in the sequence is Truthful (checking whether any elements between zero and ten with skips are even)

any(a % 2==0 for a in range(0,10,2))

True

***

$Cap$ Cumulative summing a sequence of numbers (calculating the cumulative sum of zero to ten with skips)

import numpy as np

res = list(np.cumsum(range(0,10,2)))

res
[ 0,  2,  6, 12, 20]

***

$Cap$ Given each iterable we construct a tuple by adding an index

a = ['Hello', 'world', '!']

list(enumerate(a))

[(0, 'Hello'), (1, 'world'), (2, '!')] 

***

$Cap$ Concatenating iterable to a single string

a = ["python","really", "rocks"]

" ".join(a)

'python really rocks'
